# Mathematics Graduate

Hi! Welcome to my GitHub üëã

I'm a recent Mathematics graduate actively seeking opportunities in tech or financial services.

- I've worked on projects using RStudio and Python, primarily in Jupyter Notebook and VSCode.
- Currently, I'm learning how to use SQL and Python for sorting, cleaning, and visualising data.
- Why does data matter to me? Data is a powerful tool that can be shaped to tell a story. Too often, we see graphs and statistics used out of context, cleverly crafted to mislead or spread misinformation in news and media. Now more than ever, I believe it's important to understand how data and statistics can be used responsibly to drive informed, ethical decision-making.

Feel free to explore some of the projects I have worked on below. Thanks for stopping by!

## üìÇProjects  
### Statistical Computing  
*University of Edinburgh (May 2024)*  
Designed and executed simulation studies for statistical models to evaluate the estimation and prediction performance of numerical statistical methods. Applied these simulations to real-world datasets, conducting in-depth analyses to inform model selection. Delivered comprehensive final reports, offering insights and recommendations based on rigorous statistical evaluation through Monte-Carlo simulation.

### Industrial Mathematics  
*University of Edinburgh (December 2024)*  
Focused on problems originating in industry to build relevant applicable solutions and make evidence-informed decisions in a wide range of industries, from healthcare to transport systems. Used analytical and problem-solving skills built upon a foundation of pure and applied mathematical modelling, statistics, and computing to create optimised agent based models and simulations for the development of efficient industrial process and strategies.

üíª [Virus Diffusion Project](https://github.com/nishideps/Virus-Diffusion)

### Statistical Case Studies  
*University of Edinburgh (September 2024 - present)*  
Work on consultancy style projects in teams. Each project takes the form of a data analysis problem which includes complex real-world data and detailed background and problem statement. Using R and LaTeX to produce a written report covering relevant background, details and implementation of methods used, results obtained and corresponding interpretation of the results. The first project included an investigation into the true authorship of *Frankenstein, Mary Shelley* using stylometric methods. The second project made use of the skills picked up from the first author attribution task to build our own AI Detector and check its validity and reliability.
