## Relevant Modules  
### Statistical Computing  
*University of Edinburgh (May 2024)*  
Designed and executed simulation studies for statistical models to evaluate the estimation and prediction performance of numerical statistical methods. Applied these simulations to real-world datasets, conducting in-depth analyses to inform model selection. Delivered comprehensive final reports, offering insights and recommendations based on rigorous statistical evaluation through Monte-Carlo simulation.

### Statistical Case Studies  
*University of Edinburgh (September 2024 - present)*  
Work on consultancy style projects in teams. Each project takes the form of a data analysis problem which includes complex real-world data and detailed background and problem statement. Using R and LaTeX to produce a written report covering relevant background, details and implementation of methods used, results obtained and corresponding interpretation of the results. The first project included an investigation into the true authorship of *Frankenstein, Mary Shelley* using stylometric methods. The second project made use of the skills picked up from the first author attribution task to build our own AI Detector and check its validity and reliability.
